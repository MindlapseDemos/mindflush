Mindflush / MLFC
================

This is a rushed demo we made for the pixelshow 2007 demoparty. It won 2nd place
in the demo competition.

We released this under fake nicknames and the MLFC label, because we didn't feel
it lived up to the standards we had set for "Mindlapse" productions. I think
that enough time has passed that it doesn't matter any more.

Huge greeting, so huge it wouldn't fit in the greets screen,
to the one ultimate demogroup, mindlapse. You people rule!
It's the only group that is better than us. All the rest of you suck.

Needs pixelshaders 2 or 3, not sure, don't care.
If you don't have it, fuck off.

Preferably run it on GNU/Linux, cause windows sucks big black cocks.
